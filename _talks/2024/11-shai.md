  While research on applications of dialogue systems and chatbots to language education has a long history, the large language models (LLM) revolution has suddenly brought a new wave of possibilities for language learning. This keynote will look back at 40 years of research on dialogue-based computer-assisted language learning (CALL) to identify what still holds up. We will revisit typologies of systems, tasks and effects (Bibauw, François & Desmet, 2019) in the light of generative AI chatbots. While taxonomies have to evolve, we will show that task design and learner guidance are now more decisive than ever.
  Looking forward toward LLM-based chatbots, we will summarize the findings from very recent studies on this new era of conversational agents, identifying trends in learners’ and teachers’ perceptions or usage as well as the most promising implementations in terms of learning effects (e.g., Dizon, 2024; Lai & Lee, 2024; Hınız, 2024; Ji, Han & Park, 2024; Shin & Lee, 2024; Zhang, Meng & Ma, 2024), and propose some new avenues for research.
