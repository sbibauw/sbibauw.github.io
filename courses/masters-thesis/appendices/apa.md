It's important to distinguish the APA **bibliographic** style, which only define how to format bibliographic references, and the APA **document** style guidelines, which define formatting rules in setting, typography, spelling, etc. for scientific manuscripts (typically those submitted to APA journals), as well as gold-standard recommendations for the presentation of scientific results.

## APA style guidelines for manuscripts

Most important: follow the thesis style guidelines from your university. Those are the only ones that matter.

If you're interested in best practices for manuscripts, or in doubt, refer to APA's _Publication Manual_.
