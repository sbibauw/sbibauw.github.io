## Choosing a study design

{{< figure src="../research-designs.svg" caption="Overview of qualitative (yellow) and quantitative (red) research designs" numbered="true" >}}

When envisaging a research project in applied linguistics/second language acquisition, various study designs are possible. We have to answer the following questions:

1. You want to
   - collect new data in the field (the â€˜realityâ€™ of language learning and teaching):<br>
     â‡’ [**Empirical** research](#empirical)
   - synthesize existing research publications:<br>
     â‡’ [**Bibliographic** research](#bibliographic)
2. <a name="empirical"></a>If empirical, you want to
   - observe existing phenomenons in the reality:<br>
     â‡’ [**Non-interventionist** study](#non-interventionist)
   - try out some specific process (technique, method, activity, tool, procedure...) by intervening/changing the reality:<br>
     â‡’ [**Interventionist** study](#interventionist)
3. <a name="non-interventionist"></a>If non-interventionist, do you intend to
   - observe the reality qualitatively, to understand or explain it:<br>
     â‡’ [Qualitative **observational** study]()
   - obtain a quantitative diagnostic of the reality, to measure it precisely:<br>
     â‡’ [**Survey** study]() (descriptive)
   - quantify the relationship between two aspects of the reality, by statistically measuring both:<br>
     â‡’ [**Correlational** study]() (inferential)
4. <a name="interventionist"></a>If interventionist,
   - **you are the teacher** and want to try out some pedagogical intervention(s) in **one** class to address specific problems you have encountered:<br>
     â‡’ [**Action-research**]()
   - you want to test if a specific intervention (technique, tool, ressource...) has an impact in **one** group of students:<br>
     â‡’ [Pre-experimental]() (repeated measures/pre-post, single-group design)
   - you want to test if a specific intervention (technique, tool, ressource...) has **more** impact than another one (different technique or 'business-as-usual' control group) in at least **two** groups of students:<br>
     â‡’ **Experimental** design (pre-post or posttest only, between-groups design)
     - doing it in existing groups (e.g., existing classes):<br>
       â‡’ [**Quasi-experimental** study]()
     - randomly assigning participants to each condition/group:<br>
       â‡’ (True) [Experimental study]()

## Interventionist designs

{{< figure src="../interventionist-research-designs.jpg" caption="Summary of interventionist research designs" numbered="true" >}}

- **Action-research**
  - Teacher = researcher â†’ subjective, reflexive process of a practitioner trying to implement change in their teaching practice
  - Predominantly _qualitative_ ðŸ’¬
  - Focus on the process: describing the process and reception of the intervention
- **Pre-experimental**: **single-group pretest-posttest** design
  - Predominantly _quantitative_ ðŸ“Š
  - Focus on the effectiveness of the intervention on the outcome variable (pre/posttest)
- **Experimental** design
  - Predominantly _quantitative_ ðŸ“Š
  - Focus on the effectiveness of the intervention on the outcome variable (pre/posttest)
  - Requirements:
    - 2+ groups/conditions: experimental vs. control
    - (pretest-)posttest measurement of the outcome variable
    - ideally: randomized group assignment
      - but often using existing groups in education (â†’ **quasi-experimental** design)

## Non-interventionist designs

### Quantitative designs ðŸ“Š

- **Survey** (descriptive, diagnostic: 1 variable)
- **Correlational** (2 variables)

### Qualitative designs ðŸ’¬

- Case study
- Ethnography
- Conversation analysis
- Mixed methods
