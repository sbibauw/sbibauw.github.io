I am an assistant professor of French language teaching at the University of Louvain ([UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be)), in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. I am affiliated with the Institute for the Analysis of Change in Contemporary and Historical Societies ([IACCHOS](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/iacchos)), co-directing the <abbr title="Centre de recherche interdisciplinaire sur les pratiques enseignantes et les disciplines scolaires">[Cripedis](https://uclouvain.be/fr/instituts-recherche/iacchos/cripedis)</abbr> research center, and co-affiliated with <abbr title="Groupe interdisciplinaire de recherche sur la socialisation l'éducation et la formation">[Girsef](https://uclouvain.be/fr/chercher/girsef)</abbr>. I collaborate intensely with researchers at [CENTAL](https://uclouvain.be/fr/instituts-recherche/ilc/cental), [CECL](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/cecl/) and [TeAMM](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/teamm) research groups.
I am also an associated professor at [ITEC](https://itec.kuleuven-kulak.be/), an [imec](https://www.imec-int.com) research group at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be). I was previously a professor and a French and English teacher trainer at [Universidad Central del Ecuador](https://www.uce.edu.ec).

I study **conversational <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> for language learning**, or dialogue-based <abbr title="computer-assisted language learning">CALL</abbr>, more precisely task-oriented **chatbots** (or dialogue systems) for language learning, at the intersection of task-based language teaching (TBLT), computer-assisted language learning and natural language processing (NLP). My research focuses on the instructional design and the evaluation of the **effectiveness** of conversational AI for L2 proficiency development, particularly L2 **vocabulary size**, **spoken** and **written L2 fluency**, and **longitudinal** assessment of L2 proficiency in various **instructed <abbr title="second language acquisition">SLA</abbr>** contexts.
